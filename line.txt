ðŸ”§ What this means
Git commands like git status, git log, or gitkraken (if it's trying to open a Git repo) only work inside a Git-initialized folder â€” i.e., one that contains a .git directory.

âœ… How to fix it
You have 2 main options:

Option 1: Go into a Git repo
Navigate into a folder that already is a Git repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd path/to/your/git/project
Then try again:

bash
Copy
Edit
git status
Option 2: Initialize a new Git repo
If you want to make your current folder a Git repo, runing:

bash
Copy
Edit
git init
This will create a .git/ folder, and Git commands will start working there.

ðŸ’¡ Tip for GitKraken users
If you launched GitKraken and saw that error, make sure you open a repository inside GitKraken:

Click "Open a Repo" or "Clone a Repo".

Navigate to an existing Git repository or clone one from GitHub/GitLab/etc.
